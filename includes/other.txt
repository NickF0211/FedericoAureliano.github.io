One of my hobbies is to learn about the history of the Americas. My opinions are worthless, but sometimes I get computers to collect and present historical data in a way that may not be totally worthless.
For example, here is an interactive map of over 7000 known archaeological sites in Colombia, and here is an interactive map of almost 200 years of African-American periodicals.
